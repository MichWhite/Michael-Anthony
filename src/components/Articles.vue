About three years ago, I held a psychic reading in Tramore, Co Waterford. I channeled a number of spirits that night.
“I think it was the third lady who came into see me. Her father came immediately. He had been deceased about a few years. She was happy with that. I won’t go into the details. Then her mother came a few minutes later. Then I seen this gentleman in New York. I seen the Statue of Liberty. I could see a bar brawl and that he was hit over the head with a pool cue. It killed him. I saw that and I told her. It was her son. 
<br>

“Her grandmother and grandfather came through. I knew she wasn’t entirely satisfied. I couldn’t understand why. At the end of the night, she thanked me very much. ‘Oh my God,’ she said, ‘I’ve communicated with so many. I’ve got so much information. I’m really grateful.’ But I said to her, ‘There’s something not right.’ ‘No,’ she said. ‘I’m fine.’ And she went off.
<br>

“Coming home that night from Tramore — it must have been about one o’clock in the morning — I was driving along to Glenmore, just outside Waterford. And this little boy appeared beside me in the car. He frightened the bloody life out of me. I am human after all. I’m looking at him, and he was smiling at me.
<br>

“I said, ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘My name is Darren.’ I said, ‘What are you doing here?’ He said, ‘My mother was with you tonight, but I couldn’t get through to her and I couldn’t get through to you. I died with meningitis when I was 14. Will you phone Mam tomorrow and tell her I’m OK?’ 
<br>

“That was the same lady who lost a son who was hit over the head with a pool cue. I phoned her the next day and I told her about it.”

I was asked to cleanse one old farmhouse where there was spiritual activity and when I arrived, I asked the elderly owner whether he was hearing a tapping Morse code sound. The man hadn't heard that kind of a noise but he told him that the telephone frequently rang and when he answered it, there was no-one there.
<br>

I was able to tell him that the father of a farm worker who resided in the cottage had emigrated to America on a ship and when a bad storm blew up, he asked the captain to send a Morse code message for the son. The message never got through and during all the intervening years, the energy of the dead father was trying to get through to the son. I cleansed the house and the telephone calls stopped.
