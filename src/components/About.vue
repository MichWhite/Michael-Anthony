    I am the seventh son of a seventh son. I work as a healer and psychic medium based near Hook Head peninsula in Co Wexford where I was born. I have been tuned into the spirit world since as long as I can remember.

    I can sense spirits and I move them on to the light, to the spirit world.

	Some are a lot more difficult than others because they have more energy. They try to instil fear in me and try to put me off but I have this determination. I know who I am and I'm at one with myself. I'm just a spiritual person trying to do the right thing.
    </p>

	I grew up in South Wexford and immigrated to England where I lived for 20 years before returning to live locally.
	I've always received messages but when I was a child I hid my gift for communicating with the spirit world because people either didn't believe me or were scared when I spoke about the messages I was receiving. I remember waking up very early one morning and telling my mother that a neighbor up the road had died in the middle of the night. She told me to go back to bed. A few hours later, she heard that the man had passed away.

	I would have out of body experiences. I would float out of by body and listen to my parents' conversation downstairs.
	It was difficult as a child because I was in a world of my own. I didn't tell people because they wouldn't have understood. I wasn't aware of the importance of it. All the time, I suppressed it and kept it hidden and that produced a lot of negative emotions in me.
	I worked as a roofer in the construction industry but I was in increasing demand as a spiritualist, cleansing homes and people of negative energies and now devote my life full-time to the practice.

	It was while living in London about 14 years ago that my attitude started to change during a period when I was trying to make sense of my life. I was drawn to people involved in spiritualism and started to pay more serious attention to my own gift. Over a year ago, I began attending intensive courses on spiritualism and mediumship at the world-renowned Arthur Findlay College in Stanstead, London which is part of the Spiritualist Church and receives students from all over the world.

	I have done many spiritual cleansings through word of mouth but is now prepared to offer my services more generally to the public, although I am not yet ready to break my anonymity.I do on average three or four exorcisms a year, which I refer to as “cleansings”. They can last as long as five to six hours.
</p>

	I know that many people would be skeptical about my work.I'm not out to prove anything. I'm here to help. There's no other reason. I'm not a member of a cult or a religious freak. I'm just a spiritual person trying to do the right thing.

<p>
	My wife is encouraging and supportive of my spiritual work. When I met her, I said, I'm not your ordinary man. I'm a bit different. I get messages and see things and hear things. She thought that was brilliant. She is fully supportive.

  <h2>Anonymity</h2>

	I have to protect my family and my kids. I don't want other children telling my kids that their dad is a weirdo. I also want to protect the confidentiality of my clients . I'm here to help people and that is why I'm retaining my anonymity. Most of the spirits causing negativity or strange occurrences in homes belong to people who have been unable to pass into the spirit world because of the shocking or traumatic circumstances surrounding their death, unresolved business or guilt about their behavior in life.
